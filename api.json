      "full": "The Minotaur was a monstrous hybrid with a **bull's head** and a **human body**, born from the union of Pasiphaë (wife of King Minos of Crete) and a sacred bull sent by Poseidon. Named **Asterion** but commonly called the Minotaur (\\\"Bull of Minos\\\"), the creature was imprisoned in an elaborate maze called the **Labyrinth**, designed by the master craftsman Daedalus. Every nine years, Athens was forced to send seven youths and seven maidens to Crete as tribute, to be sacrificed to the Minotaur. This continued until the hero **Theseus** volunteered, entered the Labyrinth with the help of King Minos' daughter **Ariadne** (who gave him a ball of thread), slew the Minotaur, and escaped by following the thread back. The myth symbolizes the triumph of civilization over bestial nature and has connections to Minoan bull-worship and the palace at Knossos."
