## Overview

The Minotaur was a monstrous hybrid with a **bull's head** and a **human body**, born from the union of Pasiphaë (wife of King Minos of Crete) and a sacred bull sent by Poseidon. Named **Asterion** but commonly called the Minotaur ("Bull of Minos"), the creature was imprisoned in an elaborate maze called the **Labyrinth**, designed by the master craftsman Daedalus.

Every nine years, Athens was forced to send seven youths and seven maidens to Crete as tribute, to be sacrificed to the Minotaur. This continued until the hero **Theseus** volunteered, entered the Labyrinth with the help of King Minos' daughter **Ariadne** (who gave him a ball of thread), slew the Minotaur, and escaped by following the thread back.

The myth symbolizes the triumph of civilization over bestial nature and has connections to Minoan bull-worship and the palace at Knossos.

## The Myth

### Birth

King Minos of Crete prayed to Poseidon for a sign of divine favor. Poseidon sent a magnificent white bull from the sea, expecting Minos to sacrifice it. Instead, Minos kept the bull and sacrificed another.

As punishment, Poseidon caused Minos' wife **Pasiphaë** to fall in love with the bull. With the help of Daedalus, who constructed a hollow wooden cow, Pasiphaë mated with the bull and gave birth to the Minotaur—a creature with a man's body and a bull's head.

### The Labyrinth

Horrified and ashamed, King Minos ordered Daedalus to construct an elaborate underground maze beneath the palace at Knossos—the **Labyrinth**—to imprison the monster. The Labyrinth was so complex that anyone who entered could never find their way out.

### The Athenian Tribute

After the death of Minos' son Androgeos in Athens, Minos waged war on Athens and conquered it. As tribute, Athens was forced to send **seven youths and seven maidens** every nine years to be sent into the Labyrinth and devoured by the Minotaur.

### Theseus and Ariadne

On the third tribute, the Athenian prince **Theseus** volunteered to be one of the fourteen, intending to kill the Minotaur and end the tribute.

When Theseus arrived in Crete, **Ariadne**, daughter of King Minos, fell in love with him. She gave him a ball of thread (or string) and told him to tie one end to the entrance of the Labyrinth and unwind it as he went deeper. This way, after killing the Minotaur, he could follow the thread back to escape.

### The Slaying

Theseus entered the Labyrinth, confronted the Minotaur in the center of the maze, and killed it—either with a sword or by beating it to death with his bare hands (accounts vary). He then followed Ariadne's thread back to the entrance, freed the other Athenian prisoners, and sailed away with Ariadne.

Athens was freed from the tribute.

## Archaeological Connections

### Knossos Palace

Sir Arthur Evans excavated the palace complex at **Knossos** (1900-1905), revealing:

- **Intricate floor plan**: Complex, multi-level structure with winding corridors
- **Labyrinthine layout**: Numerous rooms, staircases, and passages
- **Bull motifs**: Frescoes depicting bull-leaping, bull horns, bull imagery throughout
- **Size and grandeur**: One of the largest Bronze Age palaces

The complex structure may have inspired the labyrinth myth.

### Minoan Bull Culture

- **Bull worship**: Central to Minoan religion
- **Bull-leaping**: Dangerous ritual sport depicted in frescoes where athletes vault over charging bulls
- **Sacred bulls**: Bulls held religious significance
- **Possible origins**: The myth may reflect memories of Minoan bull rituals, Cretan power over Athens, and the impressive palace complex
